# MCM_paper

Author: Xiaotong Liu (liux4215@umn.edu)

This folder ('/MCM_paper') contains my work on the project of MCM manuscript. It also contains the code and data for my PhD thesis and defense presentation.

The data files (.Rdata, .txt, etc) are all saved in the sub-folder '/MCM_paper/data'. The scripts obtain data from that directory.

I specifically focus on organizing the scripts for figures in this folder: 
-- 1. I saved the scripts for generating the manuscript main figures and supplemental figures in the sub-folder '/MCM_paper/manuscript_figure'. The output of the scripts (figures) are also saved there. 

-- 2. I saved the figure output for my thesis and defense presentation in the sub-folders '/MCM_paper/thesis_figure' and '/MCM_paper/thesis_ppt_figures', respectively.

Other scripts are saved in the folder '/MCM_paper' for data processing and modeling.

Of note, there is a script called MCM_function.R in '/MCM_paper' that saves all the functions used in MCM modeling.
