AT1G42990 	ATBZIP60 BZIP60 	AtbZIP60 consists of a bZIP DNA binding domain followed by a putative transmembrane domain. GFP fusions containing the first 260 amino acids (AtbZIP60deltaC) are nuclear-localized. AtbZIP60 is upregulated by the addition of tunicamycin (ER stress response inductor), DTT (inhibitor of disulfide bond formation) and azetin-2-carboxylate (proline analog perturbing protein structure). Upon ER stress the protein is proteolyzed and the soluble part is translocalized into the nucleus. AtbZIP60deltaC can activate the promoters of the ER chaperones BiP1, BiP2 and BiP3 and CNX1 and CNX2 via binding to the ER stress response element (ERSE) and the plant unfolded protein response element(P-UPRE). It can also activate its own transcription.
