RIN4 physically interacts with RPS2 and RPM1 in vivo. Bacterial avirulence (Avr) effectors AvrB, AvrRpm1, and AvrRpt2 induce a mobility shift in RIN4 and expression of AvrRpt2 induces rapid degradation of RIN4. RIN4 contains 2 sites for AvrRpt2 autocleavage, called RCS1 and RCS2. Overexpression of RIN4 inhibits multiple phenotypes associated with AvrRpt2 function and also inhibits PAMP-induced defense signaling. Attached to the plasma membrane at its carboxyl terminus. Cleaved  by AvrRpt2 at two PxFGxW motifs, one releasing a large portion of RIN4 from the  plasma membrane and both exposing amino-terminal residues that destabilized the carboxyl-terminal cleavage products by targeting them for N-end ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation.
